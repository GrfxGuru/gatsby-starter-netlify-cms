blurb: GrfxMedia.com is the home of my photography. I spent some time cleaning up and improving my photography site, I think you will like it.

I had time to work on some of the visual aspects of my photography site, [GrfxMedia.com](https://grfxmedia.com) that had been bothering me.

The first thing I want to note is that my site is hosted on SmugMug, this is primarily so I can focus on the content rather than managing the site. I do recommend taking a look at SmugMug if you are looking for an easy way to host your images with convienient options to help you sell them. I'd appreciate it if you used my affiliate [link here](https://pw.d.pr/HBQLvb).

I think my design is clean allowing viewers to focus on what really matters to them, the images.
