I like to really get close to the details of a season and see what can be found. This is no random leaf, I spent a while finding just the one that caught my eye.

This one had some almost transparent areas that gave the surface a very real 3D feel, combine that with a mirror and careful lighting and things start to talk to you through the camera.
