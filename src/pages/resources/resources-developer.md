blurb: There are some fantastic resources for developers out there, so many that it can be impossible to find the really great ones. Here is a list of those that I think are indispensable as a developer.

## Tools

### [Gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)

Generate starting .gitinore files easily for many tools and languages. Perfect for keeping those repositories clean.

### [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)

A great way to store code snippets online privately, or share with others. Personally, I think you should share with the World in the spirit of learning and helping the community.

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

The Swift Package Manager is a tool to aid in the distribution of dependencies and integrates into the build system.

## Reference

### [Swift.org](https://swift.org/)

The home of the Swift open-source project. Here you can keep up with the mailing lists, download the latest SDK's, and access the documentation.
