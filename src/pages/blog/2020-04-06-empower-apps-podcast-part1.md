Excited to share with everyone that I was invited back on to the Empower Apps podcast with Leo Dion.

It ended up being such a great conversation that it has been broken into two parts.

[Here is a link](https://share.transistor.fm/s/187a54b5) to part 1 where we discuss what might be the plans and what we would love to see from the Apple developer conference this year. The only thing we know for sure right now as of this post is that Apple will be doing the conference very differently for 2020.
