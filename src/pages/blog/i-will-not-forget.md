blurb: So many ideas are forgotten because they arrive at the wrong moment in time when you cannot record it. I have my solution for that, a notepad and pen everywhere.

So many ideas come to me late at night, I tell myself I'll remember them, but more often than not, I don't. So from this day forward, there will be that notebook next to the bed with a pencil, and I _will_ write them down as they come to me. Alternatively, maybe if I think of something I want to podcast, I'll do it right there and then.
