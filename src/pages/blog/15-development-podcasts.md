Time to renew my list of podcasts that I subscribe to discussing software development and design. Some are code, others are general discussion. Podcasts are a great way to keep up with the latest news and learn new things, I love to listen to them at the gym and driving to/from work.

This list covers all levels from deep level to beginner discussion, I like to throw in something for everyone regardless of experience.

Hereâ€™s the list in no particular order with links
