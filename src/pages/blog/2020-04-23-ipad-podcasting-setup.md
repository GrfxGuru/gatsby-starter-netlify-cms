I am always looking for new ways to do things and to try simplifying, this week I wanted to see if I really could use my iPad Pro to make some podcasts if I needed to.

I tried many different set-ups when it comes to hardware. Not that there is anything wrong with the internal iPad microphone, but let’s be honest it’s all about sound quality and not picking up ambient noises how ever hard you try to be quiet.

I started by trying my [Blue Yeti microphone](https://amzn.to/3aCsmIW) and getting no where because it refused to work for anything other than an output option, even with powered hubs. I moved on to my [Audio technical ATR2100-USB](https://amzn.to/3cNk1DT).

The reason I love the [ATR2100-USB](https://amzn.to/3cNk1DT) is because I can connect with either XLR or USB. When I’m using it with my desktop to record episodes I plug it in using XLR to my [Yamaha AG06 audio deck](https://amzn.to/3byK5Cx).

But, for the iPad, I went straight from USB into the [Hyper-Drive USB-C hub](https://amzn.to/2yBqxia) that I have connected to my iPad, and it worked straight out of the box.

The [Ferrite Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1018780185?at=1010lv3Y) software I use detected it as a stereo microphone, switched input sources and was ready for me to record.

So for now, I’ll be using this as my mobile set-up, the [Ferrite Pro software](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1018780185?at=1010lv3Y) is amazing giving every edit option I need and plugin support for noise removal.

I also took the opportunity to try out my [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) site that offers microcast support. I use micro.blog for my [uibuzz.com micro blog site](https://uibuzz.com).

You can now hear the results in [Apple podcasts here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/uibuzz/id1508955437) or directly on [uibuzz.com here](https://uibuzz.com/2020/04/20/the-welcome-episode.html).

If you are looking for a simple but good quality mobile setup, I recommend trying my above set up, please feel free to reach out to me with questions and comments.
