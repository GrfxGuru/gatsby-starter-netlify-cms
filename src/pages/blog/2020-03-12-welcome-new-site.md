blurb: So after over a year of work migrating content PeterWitham.com is now on GatsbyJS

Yep,

It took over a year to migrate all the content in my spare time and do my best to make everything including existing URL’s match up. But I finally pushed the button and moved PeterWitham.com over to the GatsbyJS site away from WordPress.

It’s way faster, open source and just as cool as ever.

If you find something that doesn’t work then head over to [/Contact](https://www.peterwitham.com/contact) and let me know. I’ll fix it as quickly as I can.

Thanks for hanging in there and please, take a look around with this new super speedy site for all devices.
