I am an avid fan of Podcasts, they keep me entertained, informed and inspired throughout my day. I have listed below the Podcasts I like to listen too related to Swift, iOS, Apple and application development. They are in no particular order and cover a wide range of discussion and technical topics on the subject. I have been through a lot more over the years than are on this list, but these are the ones that made the cut in my iTunes library :)

I have included links to the feeds to make it easy for you to find them.

There are lots more out there and yes these are all listed in iTunes, I know there are other good ones that are not listed in iTunes, but to be honest if you are not listed in iTunes then you stand a lesser chance of ever being discovered because that is where most if not all iOS users and developers will be looking. It is the Mothership after all!

Anyway, check this list out if you are into Podcasts or just want to hear voices in your head different from the usual ones!

As always, if you know of some great Podcasts then contact me via the link at the top of this page or on [Twitter @compileswift](https://www.twitter.com/compileswift) as I would love to hear about them and hope to keep this list updated and need the community to help me do that.
