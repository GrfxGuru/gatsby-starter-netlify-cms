title: Trying out Netlify Gatsby Incremental Builds
date: 2020-05-12T14:33:58
blurb: As sites get more complicated and hopefully full of content. Builds take longer, Netlify is working on that.

I took a few minutes (literally) to enable beta plugin support on this site, PeterWitham.com in Netlify today.

I wanted to try out the incremental builds for Gatsby sites. Content is growing fast on this site because Iâ€™m an avid blogger. The problem with that is builds can take longer to crunch all that content.

Following [these instructions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/?utm_campaign=Gatsby+Builds+Promo+Email&utm_content=Gatsby+Builds+Promo+Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io) I was able to turn on the incremental build plugin to see if it can help with that problem.

I will keep an eye on it and see how things go. But this is a great move forward, thanks Netlify.
