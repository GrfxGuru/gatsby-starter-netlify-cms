title: Unity3D updates are far too often and too big

blurb: Another Day Another Update? I am really enjoying learning Unity, but slow down the updates.

Learning to create games in Unity3D is proving to be most interesting and a lot of fun, but the one thing driving me totally nuts is the crazy amount of updates they keep pushing out. They feel like they are happening every couple of days. Now I know I can ignore an update, but it's really annoying to have to make sure all my machines are in sync when it comes to versions and having to re-download the entire thing everything.

Please, please, someone fix Unity3D so it downloads just the delta changes. First, the packages would be smaller which saves the company money on bandwidth. Secondly, it helps us users get back in the app faster and saves us having to download gigabytes of data every time.
