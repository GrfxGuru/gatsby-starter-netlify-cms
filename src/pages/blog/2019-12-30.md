Well my goal was to hit 500 commits this year on Github.

It does not look like I am going to make it, and I do not want to make useless commits just to reach the number, but I feel I got pretty darn close at 470 as of this post.

Next year I plan to move over my BitBucket repositories so I only have to focus on one host for all my code, not only does it make it easier to manage but it also helps me track my projects better.

So next year, watch out, I have plans for much more.

As a sneak tease, this post was completely written in my own blog writing application that I built to use with GatsbyJS and Markdown.

More to come, but thatâ€™s for next year.
