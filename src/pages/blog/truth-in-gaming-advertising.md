I have always been an avid gamer, and mobile games are perhaps the best thing to happen to the smart phone for both developers and gamers. But there’s a serious epidemic that needs fixing…

I feel the time has come for there to be consequences or some kind of truth in advertising on the app stores to prevent a very annoying trend of blatant misrepresentation in game promotion videos.

    At the very least I think game players and makers need to agree to self regulate the app store

So many game trailer videos on the mobile app stores are nothing like the games, even worse they have ‘fake’ games in the trailers to make them seem like they are something they are not.

I will not name the games or the companies as I refuse to give them free advertising or draw attention to them, but I’m sure a lot of you have seen them and know of at least some of them.

Here’s the problem, which ever game is the flavor of the week, let’s say a first person shooter or particular puzzle style game, is next week appearing in videos for games completely unrelated that do not even feature that style of game play.

For example, let’s say there is a game that is a 2D scroller where you run around shooting or fighting enemies or other players. The very next week there is a video for the game, but it shows that you complete puzzles to beat the baddie, this is a total misrepresentation of the game.

At the very least I think game players and makers need to agree to self regulate the app store and call out those that seek to abuse users good (maybe gullible) nature to get download counts that they can then use for advertising or to inflate the selling price of the intellectual property to someone else.
