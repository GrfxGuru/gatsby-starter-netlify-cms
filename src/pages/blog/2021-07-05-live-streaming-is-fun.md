blurb: Over the past few weeks as I have been live streaming coding I learned a couple of things.

Over the past few weeks, I have been doing a live stream for my CompileSwift.com project. It started as an experiment to see if anyone would be interested in such a thing. What it has turned into is an excellent way to hang out with people and not be afraid to get things wrong.

For example, I’ve been struggling with writing some unit tests. Usually, that would feel like a failure. But thanks to the folks dropping by the chat room, we have resolved the issues and had some great conversations at the same time.

At first, I was afraid to do live stream coding because I was worried about people dropping in and saying how wrong my code was. But it turns out, what people seem to be looking to do is interact with like-minded folks, which is just great with me.

Given my anxiety issues with public interaction and opening myself up to strangers, this was tough, but pushing through the mental barrier has helped boost my confidence.

Nobody expects you to get it perfect, think of it as live TV. After all, that’s exactly what it is for the world we live in now. If you get something wrong just laugh it off with folks and move on, don’t dwell on it.

So, if you have wanted to do something similar, I recommend giving it a try.

If you do try it, please let me know, and I’ll drop by and say hi to show my support.
