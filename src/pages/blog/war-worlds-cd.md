title: What I'm Listening Too - War of The Worlds (Newer)
date: 2019-03-06T13:01:10
blurb: Music is a very important part of my day, especially when I'm focused on tasks like coding. I recently discovered the newer version of one of my favorite albums - War of The Worlds by Jeff Wayne. Here's my thoughts on this updated release.

I have always been a huge fan of Jeff Waynes War of The Worlds. So I had to check out the newer version, which I only recently became aware of.

Whilst nobody can replace the vocal talents of Richard Burton, Liam Neeson does an outstanding job as the narrator in this new updated version. The music style is also very acceptable, although the original will always be a classic.

I strongly recommend you check it out below, it continues to be in my cycle of music to work to.
