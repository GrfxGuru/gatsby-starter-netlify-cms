blurb: SublimeText is a very popular code editing tool due to it's speed, versitility and huge customizable appearance options. This is the theme that I am currently finding very usable for both night and day coding sessions.

My current favorite [SublimeText 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) theme and color setup. SublimeText is a program I used to use all the time and stopped for a while due to lack of development progress (not uncommon on this app). But it appears to of started up again so I thought I'd dust it off and use it for coding again for a while.

I use the [Carmesim](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Carmesim) theme with the [Dracula](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dracula%20Color%20Scheme) color scheme. I recommend installing them and any other packages via the excellent [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

Here is a screenshot of how it looks on my system.
