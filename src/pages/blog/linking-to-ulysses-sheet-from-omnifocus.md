I love using both OmniFocus for tracking my tasks and projects, and Ulysses for writing my blog posts. But until now, I never found an easy way to link to specific sheets on macOS.

This great tip from [www.usingomnifocus.com](www.usingomnifocus.com) just answered the problem for me, I'm so glad I came across their post.

Here is the [direct link to the solution on their Web site](http://www.usingomnifocus.com/2017/12/linking-to-ulysses-from-omnifocus/).
