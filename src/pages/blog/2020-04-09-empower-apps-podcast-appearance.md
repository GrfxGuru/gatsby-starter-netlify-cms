I was honored to be a returning guest on Leo Dion’s [Empower Apps](https://www.empowerapps.show/) podcast.

We had such a great time talking about Apple’s developer conference changes this year along with what we would love to see and how it might work.

Then we went on to discuss new hardware announcements and how we use devices in our daily life.

There was so much content that it broke into two episodes which you can find at the links below, and while you are there, why not [support the Empower Apps Podcast on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/empowerappsshow).
