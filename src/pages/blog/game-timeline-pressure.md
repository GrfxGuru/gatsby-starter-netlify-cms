title: Game Timeline Pressure, The End is in Sight
date: 2018-12-02T01:41:08
blurb: It's All About The Pressure. The last list of things to be done, the self imposed pressure. It's all coming along nicely as I reach the end of my first game version 1.0 release. More Soon!

OK my self imposed timeline for releasing my first game is getting short. I set a late December date and it is getting here fast.

The good news is that my Todo list is getting shorter not longer, the Web site is already ready for release and I'm now feature complete with just testing and bug fixes.

What's that? You want more details ... not just yet :) But soon.
