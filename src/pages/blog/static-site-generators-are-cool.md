blurb: I find it interesting that static content Web sites are now so easy to generate from dynamic data.

Over the past couple of weeks I have turned my attention to Web creation for a few things I am working on. This gave me a great reason to take a look at the static site generators and the hype around them.

I have to say, I’m finding the idea very appealing. The basic idea is that you use some tools to generate a site containing good old HTML, CSS and JavaScript rather than an application requiring some kind of back end.

Now I am sure you might be thinking the same as me, why go to all that complication? Well it turns out that it’s not as complicated as you might think, and the pay off is that the sites generated are fast, and I do mean fast.

Plus you can host them anywhere and not care about the backend. Thanks to some of the work flows you can adopt, you can add new content to a site, push to a repository and the site is automatically regenerated and deployed for you. Currently, I’m playing with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) which sits on top of [React](https://reactjs.org).

Expect more on this as my learning and discoveries continues.
