I love my MacBook Pro’s, I really do.

I also love USB-C because I do not have to check it is the right way when I go to plug something in.

But, the World of devices is still slow to catch up and that means I have to convert USB to USB-C. The other problem is I hate seeing cables across my desk.

That’s where these little gems come in, they are small taking up very little space and barely noticable when plugged in.

They set me back just $9.99 on Amazon and they work flawlessly on everything I have plugged them in to. So [order some now](https://amzn.to/32RrfTk) and thank me later when you are hunting down cables that you thought you had with you but turns out you left them somewhere else.
