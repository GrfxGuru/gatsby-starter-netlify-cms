blurb: Worth reading this if you follow me else where on other platforms

After some consideration I have decided to close down some of my social accounts.

Here is the list, given the nature of the way some platforms work they may become available as user names for other people in the future and **they will not be me**.

Twitter
- GGCPod
- CashOnTapGame

Twitch.tv (channels made unavailable since you cannot delete them)
- UIBuzz
- GrfxG
