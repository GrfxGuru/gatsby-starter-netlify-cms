Managing social media on the move is now very easy thanks to the iPad. There are some amazing apps that I use to write and manage my social media. Here are my workflows for you to try out.

## The TL;DR

  * [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8)
  * [LinkedIN](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin/id288429040?mt=8)
  * [Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id618783545?mt=8)
  * [Skype](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-ipad/id442012681?mt=8)
  * [Buffer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-social-media-manager/id490474324?mt=8)
  * [Discord](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746?mt=8)
  * Photos

## The Details

When I write new blog posts, upload new photographs, or create new videos, I share them to social media. Not all content I create is suitable for all social networks, but the workflow always follows the same pattern. I create a featured image if needed for my blog post, to do this I usually use a plugin for my Wordpress site called [Featured Image Generator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-generator/). I attach the image to the post and also download it into Apple Photos. Having the image in Photos means I can access it anywhere on my iPad (or Mac, iPhone).

I have an album called ‘Blog Featured Images’ that I keep them all in. I will pull up the content I want to share and use the sharing extension to access the [Buffer app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-social-media-manager/id490474324?mt=8), I either share or schedule to multiple social networks at the same time. The beauty of Buffer is that I can create network specific messages in one window.

For example, if I create a new post on the Swift programming language, I will be sharing that to the [CompileSwift Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/compileswift/) account and my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwitham) account.

### Social Media Management and Scheduling

I regularly use the [Buffer app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-social-media-manager/id490474324?mt=8) to schedule posts to social networks. This is easily done in the application and I can manage the times and days that the posts will go out. Thanks to the iPads multi-tasking I can have buffer and a Web browser open at the same time to gather content for my accounts in Buffer.

When it comes to managing responses and reading on social networks I will use the separate client apps [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8) and [LinkedIn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin/id288429040?mt=8). Each app gives me fine grain control over my response and management of messages.

[Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id618783545?mt=8), [Skype](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-ipad/id442012681?mt=8) and [Discord](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746?mt=8) are great for getting in to conversations directly with people as needed.

Slack in particular is great for keeping track of contacts and conversation history. On the iPad I can leave them all running in the background and rely on notifications to get my attention. Often I will set aside some time in the evening for conversations and responses.

### The Wrap

Thanks to my iPad Pro, I no longer need a desktop or laptop computer to keep up with social networks and the people I am in contact with. Many of these apps do have an Apple Watch version, however I find them rather limiting for anything other than telling me that there is something I will want to look at in the future. So how do you use your mobile devices for SocialMedia?
