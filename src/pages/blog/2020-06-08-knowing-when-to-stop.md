blurb: I have spent days trying code up a gatsbyjs social card system on my site. More than I should of.
---

In total I have probably spent about 3 days of time trying to create a social card system that works on my GatsbyJS site.

Iâ€™ve tried numerous plugins and tutorials, each failing at some point with non-descriptive javascript errors that do not help debug the problem.

As creators we have to recognize when we have spent enough time on something and made zero too little progress, and we have to know when to say quit and walk away.

Now that does not mean, never come back to it, but it does mean accepting that clear the answer is not coming today or tomorrow and to stop driving yourself crazy trying to solve it.

So, for now, it has to wait for another time.
