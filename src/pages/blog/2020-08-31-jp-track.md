blurb: Another great album from a talented guitarist. This track stands out as it's not all in your face notes.

The new album from John Petrucci is still settling in with me, but this track in particular stands out to me as it has a more slow soulful approach than the other tracks.

From smooth lingering blues notes to power hitting ripples each one is a great example of understanding how to construct a guitar piece.
