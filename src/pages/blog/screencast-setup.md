blurb: A lot of people ask me about my screencasts and how I make them. Well, here are all the answers.

I have been asked many times how I manage to get the quality and professional results from my screencasts that I create. Firstly, thank you to everyone that comments and compliments me on the quality of my screencasts/videos, I truly appreciate it and it inspires me to continue to make great content for you the viewers. If I could do this for a living I would, I find it so much fun and am passionate about sharing and learning together.

I have tried many different workflows and setups over time, this is my current setup.

**Software**

  * [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)

My primary screen recording and editing application, perfect for screen casting.

  * [Adobe Creative Cloud [Digital Membership]](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CS74YQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CS74YQO&linkCode=as2&tag=peter0ad-20&linkId=KRSBOSK5SK6YPFZ3)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=peter0ad-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00CS74YQO)

I use Photoshop and After Effects for creating the banners and intro/outro's.

  * [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)

A great utility for setting my application window size to 1920x1080 for HD 1:1, which is how I keep the quality of text like code so nice and crisp to read on playback.

  * Apple Keynote

For information slides when needed.

> I have to both know the subject and it has to be something I am interested in to make a good screencast.

**Workflow**

  1. I create the intro and outro clips and use those in a template that I created for ScreenFlow.
  2. I practice …. a lot! Before I start recording so that it sounds and looks natural.

  3. I actually try and record an entire screencast in as fewer clips as possible with a preference to getting everything in one take so that it sounds as if I am sitting there with you teaching rather than lots of edits. - I record the video and audio at the sametime as I work through the content which is then added to a timeline in ScreenFlow.

  4. I do not use a script, firstly I think if you use a script then it sounds like you are reading one. Secondly I believe that if I do not sound like I know the subject I am talking about then that will come across to the viewer. So I have to both know the subject and it has to be something I am interested in to make a good screencast.

  5. I’ll review and edit or even start over if needed if I am not happy with the content. 4. I uploaded to YouTube directly from ScreenFlow in full HD because I want the quality to be good on everything from a mobile device to a big screen TV. Remember you never know where your viewers are watching from today.

  6. I create a post on to make it available to you the viewer.

  7. Then finally, I start to think about my plans for the next video and start all over again!
