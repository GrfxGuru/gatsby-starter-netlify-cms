I get it, you don’t have to do anything after clicking ‘create’ in Xcode to make a new SwiftUI project, but that does not mean it’s the best place to now start writing code.

There are a few things I do first to create a clean easy to understand project structure where I can focus on my code and not the stuff that I’ll never touch but always need for a project to build.

This video runs you through those steps to a clean project structure.

Give it a try, I think you’ll appreciate the cleaner work place.
