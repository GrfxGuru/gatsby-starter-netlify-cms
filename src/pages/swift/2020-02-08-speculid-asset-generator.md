blurb: Want an easy way to automatically re/build assets in Xcode? I have it right here for you.

Learn how to automatically generate assets for Xcode using Speculid. With just a few steps you can be automating the build and rebuild of icons and images.

This can be a massive time saver for those projects where assets can change just enough times to be annoying and ensure they are always up to date.

In this example I take one SVG file and generate all the application icon sizes needed in an iOS application and as a bonus, automatically assign them to the correct targets in Xcodeâ€™s asset catalog.
