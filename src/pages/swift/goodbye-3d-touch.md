title: Goodbye 3D Touch, Hello Contextual Menu

blurb: 3D Touch Just Never Took Off. But I'm willing to bet that iOS 13's new contextual menu system gets a warmer reception.

3D touch just never seemed to really naturally fit in my workflow, it never became something I did…ever. It seems like many others did not embrace it too much either.

iOS 13 is getting a new _contextual menu_ system that you can take advantage of, and the best part is that it works on all devices that support the OS, so that means devices that do not have the force touch (or do we just call it 3D touch now?).

To me, this makes so much more sense. Users seem to be comfortable with press and hold, and that’s all you need to do to get the new contextual menu.
