Working with layouts in Xcode and the simulator has greatly improved over the years, but it is still far less than great. The cycle of edit, run, go back and edit again, run again, get's old fast. [Sherlock by Inspired Code](https://sherlock.inspiredcode.io) helps solve some of these annoying problems. This new tool essentially adds new features to the simulator that ships with Xcode. With it, you can edit views in real-time right in the simulator, this short video will show you a few of the ways it can help figure out layout problems in no time at all.
