title: Using an iOS UIPickerView to Set a Value in Another Control
date: 2019-08-18T15:20:00
blurb: My most popular tutorial is one that uses the UIPickerView control on iOS to set the value of another control. I decided to update and create a video version, here it is.

My UIPickerView tutorial is so popular that I thought I should both update it and create a video version that you can follow along in under 10 minutes. In this updated version, we create a UIPickerView control delegate, give it a data source and then update the contents of a label anytime the picker view selection changes.
