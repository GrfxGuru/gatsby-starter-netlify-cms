I am excited to see that the Vapor team has released the final version of 3.0. [Vapor 3.0 Released](https://vapor.codes/) This is going to be a great time to get into Vapor if you have not already. If you already use Vapor be sure to check out the new release and maybe try my getting started tutorial to get up and running fast. [Getting Started with Swift Vapor](/swift-archives/getting-started-with-swift-vapor/) Expect more Vapor posts in the future as server-side Swift is a thing that interests me greatly.
