The trouble with writing about a new programming language that grows up fast is anything you write is almost always behind the release curve.

Since I started writing about Swift after it was announced at WWDC14 there have been many releases that have caused more than a few re-writes of code examples again and again. The latest 1.2 release is a good example of that, so how do we deal with this scenario given that WWDC15 is rapidly approaching and we can expect more releases either big or small?

There are two lines of thought, one is to go back and re-write posts and tutorials addressing all the changes to ensure code continues to work as expected. The other is to leave them alone and continue to move forward using the newer code syntax and methodologies hoping your readers will figure out how to adapt old posts to new code and learn something in the process.

I am unsure which is the clear winner, but I favor moving on and hoping the readers understand the monumental task involved with checking all old posts. I do not believe in removing them since many times archive materials can aid someone in solving a problem, I can personally vouch for this many times over. I have decided to tag posts that contain code going forward with the version number so that it enables you the reader to easily see and search my site for answers.

I have been receiving requests from you the much appreciated readers putting requests and ideas forward for new content, I will be taking those into account as I prepare more things to share with you all. As we wait the final release of Xcode to support the Apple Watch this will indeed be a very interesting time for us all.
