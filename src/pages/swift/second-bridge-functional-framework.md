title: Second Bridge Framework - Functional Swift using Scala
date: 2015-06-05T13:29:25
blurb: Functional programming is all the rage right now, it's the thing that's cool to talk about. But as a Swift developer, how can you get started? Second Bridge is a great introduction.

I came across this project that might be of interest to developers familiar with Scala that could help them get in to functional programming in Swift.

[Second Bridge](http://47deg.github.io/second-bridge/) is an open source project that extends the [Swiftz framework](https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz) to add a lot of Scala features and language to get you up and running fast with functional programming in Swift.

You can find the site with code and details at <http://47deg.github.io/second-bridge/>
