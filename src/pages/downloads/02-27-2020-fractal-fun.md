blurb: As a graphics person, fractals have always interested me. Here's a new creation.

There is no question in my mind that my passion for computer generated graphics is as strong today as the first time I sat and played with an application called [pov-ray](http://www.povray.org).

A few days ago I decided to go in search of a new fractal generator to play with and came across [Mandlebulber2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mandelbulber/). This app has a massive amount of things to play with and I confess that so far I have been randomly discovering what most of it does.

One thing it does that really caught my interest was rendering in 3D space rather than just 2D.

So about an hour later I came up with this and it is currently my desktop wallpaper, Iâ€™ve decided to share it with you all.

You can [download](/downloads/wallpapers/pw_spaceblob.zip). the full resolution (3k) image [here](/downloads/wallpapers/pw_spaceblob.zip) for free if you want to have it on your desktop too. Please do not use it for commercial purposes unless you want me to come after you. Just saying.
