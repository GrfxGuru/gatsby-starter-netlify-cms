So Epic released a preview to the public of Dauntless, we just had to play it so we can talk about it.

We also started season 17 of Diablo 3 and because that was not enough, we also talk live streaming and our experiences with that.

To stream from my Nintendo Switch I am using the [Elgato HD60s](https://amzn.to/2QjWksA)
