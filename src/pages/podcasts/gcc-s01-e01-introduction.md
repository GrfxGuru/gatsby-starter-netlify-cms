title: New Podcast - Geezers Who Game and Code

blurb: I am working on a new podcast with a good friend of mine, we found that we talk so much about playing and creating games that we decided to turn it into a podcast.
---

I spend a fair amount of time either playing or working in ideas for creating games, I also talk with friends a lot about gaming and coding, it's only natural since I write code professionally I guess.

Therefore, I decided it was time to start a podcast talking about all these things with a good friend of mine who also spends a lot of time doing the same.

If this first episode of Geezers Who Game and Code, we introduce ourselves and some ideas of where we think our discussions are going to go. If you're a gamer of any kind, then I think this is something you should give a listen to.
