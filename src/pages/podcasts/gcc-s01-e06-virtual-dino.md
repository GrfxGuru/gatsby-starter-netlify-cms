title: Geezers Who Game and Code - Virtual Dino What Now?
date: 2019-06-07T03:20:10
blurb: Epic Released a preview of Dauntless, so it goes without saying we had to play it. We also started Season 17 of Diablo 3. Lastly we started out streaming setups, and that was an interesting experience.

Well it only took until the sixth episode to get down the rabbit hole of Virtual Dino Poop.

Yep you read that right, also, Windows audio streaming nightmare, Diablo 3 mega boost and Dauntless understood.
