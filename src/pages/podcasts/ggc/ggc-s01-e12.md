date: 2019-09-07T15:42:00

First, I talk about some YouTube streaming analysis and observations of viewership compared to Twitch, then I talk about migrating from Blizzard to Steam with my Destiny 2 account (and the cross-platform saves).

Then Newms talks about game reviews and ratings and how that influences his choice to play or not, finally I weigh in on my over analysis? Of choosing games.
