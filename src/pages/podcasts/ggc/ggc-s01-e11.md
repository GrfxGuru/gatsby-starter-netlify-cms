title: Geezers Who Game and Code - We have accidentally stumbled on the best game idea ever.
date: 2019-08-23T17:00:00
blurb: Is it really a good idea to put your game on sale? As a user it might seem like a good deal too, but in the long run is it a bad thing? We discuss both sides.

This time it is Newms' time to comment on advertising in games, yeah those things...you know, those ones that appear every time you sneeze whilst holding a mobile device.
Then, Peter shares some thoughts on downloadable demo and trial versions of games and how that has an affect on the users decision to purchase or walk away.

Oh, and feel free to eat a Nukasnicker during the episode, all will be explained.
