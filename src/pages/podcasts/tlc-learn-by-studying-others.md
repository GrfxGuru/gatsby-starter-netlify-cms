I have been thinking about the topic of improving creativity by studying the work and methods of others. In this episode I share some thoughts on how we can expand our skills and creativity by recreating what inspires us as a way to understand how we can achieve the results we desire.

Iâ€™d like to stress that it is never acceptable to plagiarize the work of others, but I do feel it is OK to learn from the work of others.
