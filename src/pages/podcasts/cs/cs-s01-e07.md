title: CompileSwift Season 1 Episode 7 - Apple September Event, 13.1 beta, macOS Catalina beta 7
date: 2019-09-01T:00:38:00
blurb: Apple's September event is upon us, there is an unusual beta release for iOS and iPadOS, plus my experiences with macOS Catalina beta 7.

This week, Apple sent out invitations to the September event, as usual we expect it to be iPhones and maybe something more? But the logo is always great fun in these invitations, I have my theories on what it means.
We also got an interesting situation with the iOS and iPadOS 13 beta's, we got a .1 release even before 13.0 shipped. I'll take a little about what that might mean and how it ties in with the September event.
Then in the last section, I installed macOS Catalina beta 7 because it is the only way I get to try out the preview system in Xcode 11. But the more interesting part is my experiences with the new security systems.
