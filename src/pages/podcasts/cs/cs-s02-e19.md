Yep, I'm following up on my own suggestion to put development out there in the public space and have successfully completed my first test stream on [Twitch.tv/compileswift](https://grfxmedia.com/compileswift)

Exciting things ahead now that I've put the pressure on myself to make this happen on a regular basis.

Subscribe for free to the Twitch channel and you to can drop by, say hello and ask questions or maybe laugh at my code :)
