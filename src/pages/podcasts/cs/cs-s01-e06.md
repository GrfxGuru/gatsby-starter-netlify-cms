title: CompileSwift Season 1 Episode 6 - State of the Betas and Foo Foo Over Features?
date: 2019-08-25T20:43:00
blurb: It has been a mixed bag of Betas this time around on the Apple platforms, let's take a look at them, and are you focusing more on Foo Foo than features?
---

In this episode I talk about the state of the beta releases for the platforms and the developer tools. Then in part 2, are you letting the foo foo get in the way of the features and purpose of your application?
