## Show Notes

Over recent years there has been a growing trend of platform convergence, especially if you are an Apple developer. We now have to allow for our users and customers running our iOS applications on a Mac, for example.

This means we have to change the way we approach application design and development, we now have to focus on the app independant of platform.

Later in the process we then account of changes that are needed to make a particular platform more accepting of our applications and features.

A few thoughts on the subject in this episode of the CompileSwift podcast.
