title: CompileSwift Season 1 Episode 10 - Should Apple Still Release Yearly OS'?
date: 2019-10-15T22:36:41
blurb: It has been a rough rollout for Apple software this year, so is it time for Apple to embrace an old approach 'Release when it's ready'?

I feel it is time for a discussion on the release cycle of Apple software, are they trying to meet impossible deadlines and still deliver good quality releases?

I think it might be time for every other year major releases.
Plus, embracing dark mode on iOS needs a plan, some thoughts on how to go about adopting it.
