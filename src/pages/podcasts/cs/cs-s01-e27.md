## Show notes
The final important step to success is making the production build to push to the AppStore. This might sound simple, but you should have a checklist of things so you get it right and stand a good chance of passing review and happy customers.

In this episode, I discuss the flow of pushing to the store from Xcode and the checklist of items I have for making sure everything is as it needs to be.
