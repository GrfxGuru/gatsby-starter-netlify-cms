## Show Notes

If you are a developer on Apple's platforms then you have probably encountered signing certificates and profiles. They start out fine, then they expire and can become a nightmare to deal with.

So I'll explain the problem if you don't know what it is and a possible solution that might help fix it. I'll even give this idea for free to Apple if they want to adopt it.
