UIBuzz is my podcast where I talk about user design, interaction, and anything related to the subject of making users happy. In this new episode I give a brief overview of SwiftUI for those that are curious and never looked into the topic.

You can find the podcast here if you would like to follow and get new episodes, the back catalog includes subjects like GatsbyJS, Unity, and so much more.
