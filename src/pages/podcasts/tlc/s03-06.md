Show Notes:

I get it, you just did something cool and want to tell the World, but you did that 10 minutes ago, should you wait longer for that next release? Is it too much in one go? Does everyone really want a 2 hour podcast to listen too?
Some thoughts on all those things, pace and delivery can make the difference between an on-going conversation and attention or a way to send people to sleep.
