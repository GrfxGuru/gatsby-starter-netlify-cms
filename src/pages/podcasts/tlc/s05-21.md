I brought back the midweek minute episodes of The Life Creative podcast, partly because I miss making them and partly because I think you need the challenges. Just kidding, you are on top of those projects right?

In this episode Iâ€™m going to challenge you to write down the progress you would like to see on one of your projects over the next seven days. Then, seven days from now, I want you to look at what you wrote and see that progress happened.

So my tip here, is make them achievable. Nothing crazy big.
