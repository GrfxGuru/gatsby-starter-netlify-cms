blurb: Do It Live and Unedited! Live streaming as you create, yep sounds scary and it is. But it can also be a great way to share and learn from others while you create. Viewers might even help you solve problems as you work on them. Listen to this episode for details.

This week I truly stepped out of my comfort zone and decided to take on something new. Live streaming is very popular, you mostly find it on YouTube and Twitch. A lot of the time it is people playing computer games, but there is also a growing trend of artists and programmers streaming as they create. This caught my attention and I decided I wanted to explore it further.

So after a lot of reading and research, this week I started testing different setups to find the one that worked for me, given that I'm new at this, it's probably not the best out there. But I do strive to do the best I can with everything I work on, so over time I am sure it will improve.

I will share more on this streaming idea as it comes together, but for now, I have tested streaming some game playing and that seemed to go well. Now to set up my programming and podcast creation to stream while I work on them.
