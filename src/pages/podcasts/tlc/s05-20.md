I get it, the excitement of finishing some big series of changes and wanting to push it all live.

But stop! Did you consider what making a lot of changes at once for your users will mean for them?

We want our readers/users/listeners to feel comfortable, especially those that have been with us a while. Making significant changes at once can have the opposite effect.

Instead, I suggest introducing those changes over time so we give them a chance to learn, adapt, and embrace rather than feel confused or even leave us altogether.

In this episode I offer some thoughts and suggestions on how we can help them adapt to the new World we might be building for them, and help them appreciate our efforts rather than fight against them.
