I was watching a video of [Harumi Tanaka](https://youtu.be/1F12qUyIACM), a masterful fountain pen maker on YouTube. He was saying towards the end of the video how some people hold their breath as they are turning the outside edge of the barrel of the pen to help them focus.

This got me thinking and I realized that I do the same thing at critical moments. I bet most of you do as well if you stop and observe your actions.

So how about you, what moments give you pause to hold that breath and focus on the moment?
