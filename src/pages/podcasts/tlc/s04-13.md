I have a lot more details that I cover beyond this episode in a blog post on my photography site GrfxMedia.com [You can read it here.](https://www.grfxmedia.com/Blog/Time-for-a-change)

Let's talk camera's for a moment, I traded in my beloved 5D mark2 and don't know what to do next.

Please note this episode was recorded on move, I have done my best to clean up some of the bumps and bruises in the audio.
