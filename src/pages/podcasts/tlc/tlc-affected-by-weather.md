Note: This episode was record on the move in some really terrible weather so the quality may not be what you are used to.

Over a long time now I have noticed something, the weather greatly affects my creative mood and output. When it's damp and raining it somehow pushes me to a higher level.

Terrible storms in Texas today reaffirmed this for me, so I thought I would share some interesting observations.
