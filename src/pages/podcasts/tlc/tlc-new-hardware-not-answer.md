title: The Life Creative - New Hardware is Not the Answer
date: 2018-05-11T17:25:18
blurb: Buying Things is Not the Answer! New camera, phone, brush, computer. All of these things we buy to try and fool ourselves that it will solve our creative drought. Listen on in this podcast episode to see what I think about that.

I published a new episode of "The Life Creative" Podcast this week. We often buy things thinking they will help us get over some block or creative drought. More often than not, this never solves the problem. Give the episode a listen and see what you think, I welcome thoughts and feedback.
