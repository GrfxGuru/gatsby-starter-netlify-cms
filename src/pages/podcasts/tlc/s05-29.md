This is a fun challenge I think, I did this myself over the last week and learned a lot. I want you to take an existing project that you feel could be improved. Then, sit down and consider a new direction you could try with it and monitor the results.

Most of the time this results in a better outcome and you will learn something about the project that you never noticed before.
