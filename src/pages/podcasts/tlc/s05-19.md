I am a big fan of [Podyssey.fm](https://podyssey.fm) because I get to discuss, discover, and recommend podcasts to like minded people.

The founders are nice people and very responsive to feedback and actively take part in many of the discussions. All the conversations are positive and respectful, which is huge for a network site.

Listen to this episode to discover all the details and why I think you should check it out (hey itâ€™s free!).
