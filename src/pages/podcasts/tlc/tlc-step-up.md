blurb: Perfection Never Ships, Procrastination Never Stops. There is a point that you have to set creativity on a path, and sometimes that means just good enough is all you need. A video on why shipping less than perfect is good for your creativity.

This is a different type of post than I normally do, which serves to demonstrate the very content I talk about in the video. Stepping up and doing it, putting concerns and quality aside and shipping something. How to let creativity flourish by removing the burden of over production and perfection. Enjoy.
