My problem might be my biggest strength.

When I start something new I go all in, straight for the deep dive. I'll learn as much as I can, practice and push myself to do the best job I can at whatever it is. That's my strength, it should be yours as well.

Please take a moment to rate and review this podcast, it really helps me know if I am on the right track. Thanks!
