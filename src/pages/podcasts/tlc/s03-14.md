I think it is very important to always be you. I get that for some people they might not like that, or maybe they do not appreciate the way you dress or talk.

But by always being you, they know what they are getting, first and foremost that is honesty and it sets a level of expectation going forward.

Please take a moment to rate and review this podcast, it really helps me know if I am on the right track. Thanks!
