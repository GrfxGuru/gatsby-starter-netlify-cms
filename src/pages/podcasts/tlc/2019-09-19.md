Show Notes:

*Part 1*
Every time I start a project, I believe it's the one that is going to work out and make the difference. I have to, and you should as well, why? Because if you do not believe in it at the beginning, why bother even doing it.

*Part 2*
Do you maintain a list of skills you want to work on? I do, I have a list of skills I want to improve and a list of skills that I want to learn. This keeps me motivated and excited to try new things.
