In this episode of The Life Creative, I talk about using prioritization as a way to free you up to have a better creative experience. Sometimes, the things blocking us are those that we know we need to get done but avoid doing. Freeing the brain from stressing about these tasks is a great way to open it up for the things it likes to do, be creative.
