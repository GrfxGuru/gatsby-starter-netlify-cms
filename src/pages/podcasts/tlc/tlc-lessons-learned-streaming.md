I did what I said I would this week and started streaming video, this were mostly tests to check that I had everything working both as expected and as I understood the process.

For the tests I streamed my game play of Diablo III, a popular game on many platforms. I decided to stream from my PC.

If you would like to see the streams you can check them out at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GrfxG">YouTube</a> and my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/grfxg">Twitch.tv</a> channels.

The lessons learned taught me a lot and gave me enough information to improve going forward, listen to the episode for all the details, plus a sneak at an idea for a new series of topics.
