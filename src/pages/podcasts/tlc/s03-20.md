Why getting and giving feedback is important. I do not mean just clicking that thumbs up or down, or +1 on something. I'm talking about telling someone why you are doing it, what it is you liked or what you thought was not so great.

We owe it to people to tell them what we thought of it if there is a system in place to do so.

Plus, you can only improve if you get feedback. I'll talk about all this and more.
