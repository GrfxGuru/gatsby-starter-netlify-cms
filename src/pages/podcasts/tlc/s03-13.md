blurb: Ditch the new year resolutions, you probably won't achieve them. Here's a better suggestion.

New year resolutions do not work for most, so save yourself the pain and just don't do it!

I have a better suggestion, set regular achievable goals instead. Maybe for you that's weekly or monthly, but trust me, you will be happier and you'll achieve far more of them than failing once a year.
