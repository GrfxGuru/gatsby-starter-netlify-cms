Show Notes:
Do you like silence?
For me, silence is a great way to recharge my battery and gives me the opportunity to focus. But I appreciate it's not that way for everyone. Silence in todays society is almost a weird fifth wheel.

[Support this Podcast and my other work on Patreon](https://patreon.com/pwcom), I would very much appreciate it.
