**Show Notes:**

Through a series of synchronistic events I have a new project I am working on. For the first time, I am making paid content.
In this episode I share my thoughts on the project, what it is, how I plan to do it, and how I think it will work.
For anyone that has ever made something to share and ask for payment, I am sure you will have experienced a lot of these thoughts and concerns.
