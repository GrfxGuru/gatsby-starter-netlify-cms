Nova, by [Panic](https://panic.com), is the new hotness IDE for Web development Mac users. I think it would be fair to say that if you are a developer of anything and use a Mac, you have probably heard of Panic software.

I started using Nova today and that mean't configuring my GatsbyJS sites to run in the app. I was very impressed with how easily I was able to set up a task to perform a package install and then run the local development server AND open the site right in Nova.

This video shows you how to set it up in just a few minutes.
