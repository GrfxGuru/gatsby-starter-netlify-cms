I am a long time user of Parallels for Mac. The reasons are simple.

1. It is easy to work with.
2. I can install an OS I need quickly and safely without concern for my production environment.

I recently set up an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS install and decided it was time to update my video, which is still one of the most popular on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/grfxg).

Every step is covered to make it easy for you to follow along.
