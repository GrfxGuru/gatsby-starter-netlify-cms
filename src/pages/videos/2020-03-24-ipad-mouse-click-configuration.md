blurb: Now that we have mouse and trackpad support on iPad. Let's enable right/secondary click with this video.

We have cursor, mouse and trackpad support now on the iPad.

However, by default you only get one mouse button click support turned on by default.

So you are wondering, how do you get that secondary/right click?

Iâ€™m going to show you how to configure it in the settings right here. As a bonus, depending on how you configure it you can setup left and right-handed user support.
