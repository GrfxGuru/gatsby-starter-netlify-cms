Windows is also looking at Arm based chips. The Windows 10 Arm64 insider preview is amazingly fast on my M1 MacMini thanks to Parallels for Mac.

In this video, I’ll walk you through the steps of installing the OS and configuring the virtual machine, all in under 10 minutes. That’s faster than installing Windows on a PC!
