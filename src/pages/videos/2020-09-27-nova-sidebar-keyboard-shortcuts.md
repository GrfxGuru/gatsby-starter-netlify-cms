title: Set Keyboard Shortcuts for the Nova Sidebar
date: 2020-09-27T02:27:11
blurb: The sidebar in Nova does not have keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs by default, let's fix that right now in this short video.

Nova by Panic has a nice configurable sidebar but it has a flaw. There are no keyboard shortcuts by default to switch between the tabs. In this video, I'll show you how to configure a simple system using the same keys as Xcode, CMD+1, CMD+2, etc. to switch tabs.

I am baffled as to why this would not be set by default in the app.

After setting up these keyboard shortcuts we no longer have to keep reaching for the mouse so much, something that makes a lot of coders happy.
