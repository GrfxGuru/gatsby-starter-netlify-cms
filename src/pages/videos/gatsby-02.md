In part 2 of this video series, I am going to explain the structure of a Gatsby site and how the files work together. Then I will take a basic page and explain how React's components play their part in the creation of those pages.

People often start to get worried when they first see a page and component created with JavaScript instead of normal HTML and CSS, but here's the secret way to think about this...

Normally we insert our JavaScript into HTML pages, but using React based systems, all we need to do is reverse that and realize that we are just inserting our HTML instide JavaScript code. That is the simple trick to switching your brain to start working with components.
