blurb: Gatsby is a static site generator built on top of React. Static sites are becoming all the rage again due to their very fast load times, something very important for mobile. In part one I will explain what Gatsby is and how to install and create your first site from a template.

I recently started looking into [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Gatsby is a static site generator that builds amazingly fast Web sites due to the content being mostly HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Now, do not make the mistake of thinking that this in any way limits you, it is actually the opposite. Because the content is generated and then put on the server users visiting your site get a very fast page load time and you get the benefit of not having to worry about any backend services or site exploits.

This first video will walk you through what Gatsby is, how to install it locally and then generate your first Web site. Once you have finished this part, move on to [Part 2 here](/jamstack/gatsby-structure-file-overview) where we start looking at files, pages and components.
