title: Revisiting an old friend. Code Notes For iOS
date: 2019-09-08T03:01:00
blurb: Code Notes for iOS is an open-source application I built because I needed a note taking app for development notes, and to learn iOS. Now it's time to step it up!
---

So I decided it was time to revisit my open source iOS project. The app has been something that I work on when time permits, partly as a learning enabler but also an app I wanted to have.

Code Notes for iOS is still in the very early stages, but I wanted a place to stash all my little code snippets and learning notes.

Revisiting it now with several goals.

- Cross-Platform support.
- Update it to use native iOS dark and light themes rather than the custom system I built.
- Update it to use cloud save rather than CoreData.
- Take a look at using SwiftUI.

So with that, if you are interested in the current state of the code, you can find it on gitHub.
